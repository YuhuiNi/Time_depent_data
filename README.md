# Time depent data
This is a project investigating whether or not the climate is getting warm using central England temperature History Dataset.

What I did is as following
* Estimated the trend in seasonal temperature data using Polynomial and Periodic Regression Smoothers, and non-parametric smoothing methods, such as nearest neighbor, and splines
* Designed and implemented an ARIMA model and performed out-of-sample test, compared the actual data and confidence band of prediction, and concluded that the warming trend does not slow down, but even become faster
